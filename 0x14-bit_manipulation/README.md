INTRODUCTION

This project is about bit manipulation. The key learning objective of this project is to understand how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators. To meet the requirement of this learning objective, the following tasks are attempted:

Task 0
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

Task 1
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

Task 2
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

Task 3
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task 4
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task 5
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Task 6
Write a function that checks the endianness.

Task 7
Find the password for this program.

Save the password in the file 101-password
Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
julien@ubuntu:~/0x14. Binary$ ./crackme3 `cat 101-password`
Congratulations!
julien@ubuntu:~/0x14. Binary$

You're welcome and happy solving!
